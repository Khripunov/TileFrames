# TileFrames

React demo that recreates tile groups similar to the DevExpress Tile Control. Switch between density presets, toggle
borders, activate tiles, and collapse groups while keeping a responsive grid.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app uses Vite. If you cannot install packages in your environment, you can still inspect the source in `src/`.
